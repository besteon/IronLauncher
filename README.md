# IronLauncher

IronLauncher is an all-in-one launcher for the IronMon Pokemon challenge. It allows you to easily play and switch between modes without installing patches and configuring tracker settings.

- Currently only supports the English version of Fire Red v1.1 (SHA1 **dd5945db9b930750cb39d00c84da8571feebf417**)
- Only supports Windows 11 (Linux + Steam Deck planned)
